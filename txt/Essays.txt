   * Your educational journey: While some reach their goals following well-trodden paths, others blaze their own trails achieving the unexpected. In what ways have you done something different than what was expected in your educational journey? (225 Words or Fewer)


I believe that I had a very different high-school journey than many students in my age group. While most students my age were dedicated only to academics and believed that professional life starts after you have completed your studies, I was an outliner; I gained professional experience, organising talks with several payload launch-providers and representatives of national-agencies, even before I completed my 11th-grade.
Being the founder of a group working on innovating and miniaturizing space-payloads is a path I made for myself which had not been pre-designed for me. It was all built on my own, and embarking on this unexplored path is something that, in my opinion, distinguished me from others.
Moreover, my efforts didn’t remain at forming a team; we at VisionCosmos launched a suborbital-payload, which became the first payload to be launched from Canada’s first private spaceport, Spaceport Nova Scotia. The payload was built entirely from scratch, and I was involved hands-on with its electronics connections, component layout, soldering, and programming. The project involved extensive collaboration between entities from three countries.
Through this payload-development process, and many others such as being a mentor at NASA’s Space Apps Challenge, I gained substantial professional experience, learnt networking, developed hardware skills regarding electronics and PCB-development, and much more.


Thus, I trust, I made my own path, a unique path, and followed upon it.

Learning from challenges: How did you manage a situation or challenge that you didn’t expect? What did you learn from it?*
(225 words or fewer)
Everyone enjoys studying in one school, having constant friendships, and immersing themselves in a familiar routine. However, my challenge, caused due to my father's transferrable job, was moving through six different schools in two countries, with each change presenting its own unique challenges. Each transition has required adjusting to new environments and peer groups.
Looking ahead was difficult, as each new school brought new customs, and different traditions to navigate. A change of school environment and of classmates added to the challenge, often making me feel like an outsider in the classroom. Saying goodbye, after staying at a school for a very short time, is not the best memory.
On the bright side of things, these constant transitions helped me develop my academic resilience, cultivate skills, and learn the value of continuous effort to socialise and be independent.
Adapting to this continuous change became a moral in perseverance and adaptability. I learnt the importance of engaging with diverse groups of people and building new friendships—skills that are very important in any environment. So much so that I actually went ahead to represent the new schools at various prestigious events and won them awards within the short time I was a student there.
These qualities have become integral to my identity, proving invaluable as I pursue a career in engineering, where problem-solving and flexibility are essential.

Throughout my academic career, there have been various challenges, but one that tested my resilience, adaptability, and determination was the constant change of schools due to my father's transferable job. Shifting through six schools and studying in three different cities was difficult; the constant loss of classmates and teachers was not easy. Each transition has required adjusting to new environments, and peer groups.
Looking ahead was difficult; each new school brought unknown customs, and different traditions to navigate. However, I haven’t allowed this challenge to affect my academic achievements. Even after doing my 10th, 11th, and 12th grades all from different schools, I quickly adjusted to new environments by actively participating in class, fostering positive relationships with new classmates and teachers, participating in school-related competitions, and more. I won a national-level quiz competition (2023-24) representing International Indian School Dammam, just seven months after joining the school in grade 11. Similarly, I won first place as a Modern Middle East International School student at the Indian Embassy’s inter-school quiz competition in Riyadh six months after joining the school in 12th grade (2024-25).
These qualities have become integral to my identity, proving invaluable as I pursue a career in engineering, where problem-solving and flexibility are essential.

A solid grasp of Circuits and Computer engineering courses such as chip-design, Internet of Things, Machine Learning would provide me a foundation to design and program satellite-subsystems for data collection, processing and transmission units, which are vital for any satellite systems.
Courses in Nanodevices and Nanosystems would significantly help me to research and develop advanced miniaturized payloads for suborbital flights, orbital, lunar applications, and beyond. I plan to do my Design and Project Course in Nanofabrication of Electrical Devices. All these courses would provide me with critical insights in developing innovative and miniaturized satellite components, which are core to my interest.

   *  Reflect on a social or community issue that deeply resonates with you. Why is it important to you, and how have you been involved in addressing or raising awareness about it?




Whenever I visited my hometown in India, one thing I enjoyed a lot was looking out from the veranda, soaking in the twinkling stars across the calm and pristine night sky. This is one thing I missed severely in the hustle and bustle of the city, and this memory has stayed with me while I am a Dark Sky Advocate.


When I researched the topic, I realised that the slow and steady deterioration of the night sky was not merely an aesthetic issue. 


While playing the role of an advocate, I realised that the problem of night sky deterioration has more profound implications for human health, ecosystems, and cultural heritage.
Light pollution caused by excessive artificial lighting in our urban landscape has horrifying effects, such as adversely affecting the natural human sleep cycle and disorienting migrating species.


My ongoing work on space technology made me more aware of the intersection between science, technology, and sustainability. I was determined to make a difference in preserving nature.
My efforts began at a very basic level, with education and awareness. I organised sessions in school to explain how light pollution adversely affects our planet. These talks emphasised concepts like how to mitigate the damage caused by light pollution.


This journey has taught me that change can begin with a small but tangible step. I understand how collective efforts can make a difference. It could be something as small as requesting a neighbour to adjust his lights to avoid undirected and ineffective lighting, or as impactful as lobbying for policy changes.


As educated and conscious human beings, I believe we are in charge of preserving our planet's purity and beauty. I am eager to continue my advocacy for preserving one of humanity’s oldest friends, the night sky, at Boston University.

Personal Statement (Optional)

This is your opportunity to share something about yourself that is not already reflected in your application or academic records. Tell us something about yourself, your experiences, or activities that you believe would reflect positively on your ability to succeed at Penn State.

While the Personal Statement is not required, it is highly encouraged. (650)
Something I believe is important to note in my application is a particular aspect of my school life, one that tested my resilience, adaptability, and determination. That aspect is the constant change in schools I had. Shifting through six schools and studying in three different cities was difficult; the constant loss of classmates and teachers was not easy. My first transition occurred between Grades 3 and 4 in 2016, followed by another shift between Grades 5 and 6 in 2018. The next move came shortly after, between Grades 6 and 7 in 2019. I transitioned from Grade 10 to 11 in 2023 and prepared for another change from Grade 11 to 12 in 2024. Each transition has required adjusting to new environments, peer groups, and school traditions, shaping me into a more flexible and open-minded learner.
Looking ahead was difficult; each new school brought new classmates, unknown customs, and different traditions to navigate. It was challenging to adapt to the uncertainty of these constant changes, but each experience taught me how to integrate quickly into new environments.
However, even after doing my 10th, 11th, and 12th grades from different schools, I quickly adjusted to new environments by actively participating in class, fostering positive relationships with new classmates and teachers, participating in school-related competitions, etc. I won the national-level Quiz competition (2023-24) as a student of International Indian School Dammam, just seven months after joining the school in grade 11. Similarly, I won first place as a Modern Middle East International School student at the Indian Embassy’s quiz competition in Riyadh six months after joining the school in 12th grade (2024-25).
I embraced these changes and became comfortable communicating with people in new environments. This experience significantly enhanced my communication and socialising skills.
Another aspect of my high school journey that I would like to mention is advocating for a dark sky, becoming a Dark Sky Advocate under Dark Sky International. Light pollution caused by excessive artificial lighting in our urban landscape has horrifying effects, such as disorienting migrating species and adversely affecting the natural human sleep cycle.
My ongoing work on space technology made me more aware of the intersection between science, technology, and sustainability. I was determined to make a difference by preserving nature.


My efforts began at a very basic level, focusing on education and awareness. I organised sessions in school to explain how light pollution adversely affects our planet. These talks emphasised crucial points such as the unimaginable damages caused by light pollution.


This journey has taught me that change can begin with a small but tangible step. I understand how collective efforts can make a difference. It could be something as small as requesting a neighbour to adjust his lights to avoid undirected and ineffective lighting, or as impactful as lobbying for policy changes.


As educated and conscious human beings, I believe we are in charge of preserving our planet's purity and beauty. I am eager to continue my advocacy for preserving one of humanity’s oldest friends, the night sky, at Penn State.
